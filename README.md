# RSA Encryption/Decryption Application
This Python application leverages the Tkinter library to provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for RSA encryption and decryption. 
Key functionalities include:

Key Generation: Generates RSA key pairs (private and public keys) of 2048-bit size.
Key Management: Allows users to save generated keys to PEM files and load keys from existing files.
Encryption: Encrypts user-entered plaintext messages using selected public keys.
Decryption: Decrypts encrypted messages using loaded private keys.
Error Handling: Utilizes logging and message boxes to handle and notify users of encryption or decryption failures.
This application relies on the cryptography library for RSA cryptographic operations 
and offers a user-friendly interface to perform encryption and decryption tasks seamlessly.
